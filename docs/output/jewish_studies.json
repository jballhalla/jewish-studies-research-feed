          "authors": "Simcha Gross",
          "abstract": "Abstract: This essay offers a contextual study of classical rabbinic discussions concerning male head coverings, disentangling them from the teleological framework of the later kippah or skullcap, for which these texts have often been cited as origins or normative foundations. It demonstrates that male headdress was deemed appropriate in different situations; bore different material forms; and carried distinct social, cultural, and theological connotations in Palestinian and Babylonian rabbinic literature. The differences between these two bodies of literature derive from their prevailing Roman and Sasanian sociocultural backgrounds, but also from developments over time that occurred within Jewish thought and customs. The late antique rabbis in Palestine and Babylonia therefore present a captivating test case to examine how the semiotics, forms, and practices associated with clothing both remain constant among self-identifying groups and change relative to the circumambient cultures in which the wearers live.",

          "title": "Educating for the New Jerusalem to Deliver the Messianic Age: A Fabulative Friendship with Louis Finkelstein and James Baldwin",
          "authors": "Cara Rock-Singer, Leslie Ribovich",
          "abstract": "Abstract: James Baldwin (1924–87) and Rabbi Louis Finkelstein (1895–1991) never met, but they shared symbols of critique and redemption, first-century Rome and a New Jerusalem, respectively. Furthermore, they both identified public education as an essential site for achieving a messianic future for the American nation. This essay examines a selection of their writings and speeches to show how Baldwin and Finkelstein mobilized politically and theologically potent symbols of exploitation, materialism, and violence to diagnose the injustices embedded in American society and chart paths for more just and secure futures for their communities. In conversation with Baldwin and Finkelstein, we examine how their theologies can be used to draw out the problematics of and offer correctives to what contemporary scholars have identified as American secularism. By staging an intellectual friendship between two thought leaders who contended with the limitations of American narratives of freedom and equality, we identify not only the problematics of a white Protestant category but also tools emerging from Jewish and Black traditions for forging alternative just futures.",

          "title": "Gossip, Rumors, Rehabilitation Israel Najara's Shaming Revisited",
          "authors": "Edwin Seroussi",
          "abstract": "Abstract: Gossip and rumor as a source of historical information has occupied scholars from different fields in the humanities and social sciences for several decades. This essay addresses a series of severe accusations against the poet and musician Rabbi Israel Najara (ca. 1550–ca.1625) cast by (or in the name of) Rabbi @Hayim Vital (1543–1620) in his Sefer ha-@hezyonot, a revelatory and deeply personal diary that was not published in its original version until 1954. However, this text circulated secretly in manuscripts and orally among the rabbinical elites of the Ottoman Empire and beyond, mostly in abridged or censored versions, some of which were printed. In addition, Rabbi Menachem di Lonzano (ca. 1550–1626) also made a series of accusations against Najara's poetics and by implication, about his persona. The gossip and rumors unleashed by Vital and Lonzano generated counternarratives designed to clear Najara, whose musical poetry had become a staple of modern Sephardic spirituality and to some extent Ashkenazi too. Chiefly among those involved in clearing Najara's reputation were individuals associated with Sabbatian circles, while accusers included important figures of Ashkenazi orthodoxy. The toxic core of these rumors and gossip persisted until the present. The motivations behind contemporary accusers and defenders of the controversial poet-musician of Safed, Damascus, and Gaza, including those from within academia, are thoroughly analyzed in their historical and social contexts.",

          "authors": "Shai Secunda",
          "abstract": "Abstract: Scholars have extensively used the Babylonian Aramaic incantation bowls to illuminate the language, history, religion, culture, and social setting of Babylonian Jewry and the Babylonian Talmud. Yet despite a growing number of parallels identified between the bowls and the Talmud, scholars have not extensively explored what these correspondences can teach us about the circulation of texts in Jewish Babylonia and their incorporation into the Talmud and the incantation bowls. This essay closely examines three talmudic texts paralleling material in the bowls: a spell recorded at bPes 110a, an invitation formula appearing at bTan 20b, and a divine exaltation at bBer 10a. Instead of reflecting straightforward processes of quotation and citation, these texts exemplify the creative dynamics through which Babylonian Jewish texts were distributed and reworked inside and outside of the Babylonian Talmud.",

          "authors": "Jonathan Howard",
          "abstract": "Abstract: The geographical provenance of the so-called Palestinian vocalization signs has mainly been based on a single medieval reference, a passage in R. Jacob ben Samson's commentary to tractate Avot (twelfth century, northern France). While past scholars disputed over the precise details of this passage, for the most part the accepted Palestinian origin of the vocalization signs remained intact. However, a renewed examination of this passage leads to the conclusion that Jacob's invocation of the term \"pointing\" (nikud) does not in fact refer to vocalization signs but rather to cantillation signs, undermining the theory that the \"Palestinian\" vocalization is in fact Palestinian.",

          "title": "The Ascent of Fallen Jews: Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi's Politics of Hope in Light of Walter Benjamin",
          "authors": "Tsiona Lida",
          "abstract": "Abstract: This article puts two thinkers, Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi and Walter Benjamin, into conversation for the first time to consider the affective structures at work in historical writing. In Zakhor (1982), Yerushalmi announces a \"rupture\" between Jewish collective memory and modern historiography. History, Yerushalmi declares, has superseded sacred text as the arbiter of Judaism and become \"the faith of fallen Jews.\" Despite this melancholic diagnosis, Yerushalmi remains committed to historicism and to transmission: what Jews hold onto, nonetheless, even as the possibility of collective memory recedes into the past. A deep ambivalence underscores Yerushalmi's work: although he identifies historical writing as a violent rupture, he is reluctant to name its political implications and clings to the hope that it offers. I read Yerushalmi in light of Benjamin's \"On the Concept of History\" (1940), which, in contrast, offers an uncompromising critique of historicism and an account of the emotions that structure it. I compare Benjamin's and Yerushalmi's orientations toward time (past and future) to distinguish the way that each thinker conceives of \"hope,\" as well as to reveal what, for them, is at stake in historical temporality—namely, the possibility of redemption. I argue that Yerushalmi's historicism is the kind that Benjamin critiques: it affords the reader a sense of comfort in Zionist futurity. In sum, this inquiry seeks to demonstrate the affective qualities of historical writing by considering how history relates to both past and future as a mediator of concepts, feelings, and political involvement in the world.",
