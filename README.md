# Paper Colection

A weekly basket with the latest published research in Jewish studies and related fields. On Fridays at 2 AM UTC, we query the Crossref API for new research articles that appeared in the previous 7 days across relevant journals. [https://jballhalla.github.io/jewish-studies-research-feed/](https://jballhalla.github.io/jewish-studies-research-feed/)

The crawler lives in the `main` branch of the backend while the website is rendered from the `gh-pages` branch.
