# Friday Article Roundup

A weekly feed of the latest published research articles in Jewish Studies and related fields, like Jewish Education. On Fridays at 2 AM UTC, we query the Crossref API for new articles that appeared in the previous 7 days across relevant journals. [https://jballhalla.github.io/jewish-studies-research-feed/](https://jballhalla.github.io/jewish-studies-research-feed/)

The crawler lives in the `main` branch of the backend while the website is rendered from the `gh-pages` branch.

Forked from [https://github.com/sumtxt/picnic/](https://github.com/sumtxt/picnic).
