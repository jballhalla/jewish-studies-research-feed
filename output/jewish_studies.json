          "authors": "Sarah Wobick-Segev",
          "abstract": "This article explores the changing discourse on hilkhot niddah in 19th-century German-speaking Europe, where women’s declining observance of these halakhot—especially mikveh use—has been frequently noted. It first surveys key factors in the perceived decline of niddah observance, including secularization and the hygiene movement. It then turns to an underexplored source: prayer books and devotional literature written for, and rarely by, women. Although scholars have extensively analyzed early modern devotional texts for insights into women’s personal and sexual lives, similar 19th-century sources have received little attention. While most of these works omit reference to niddah, seemingly reflecting declining observance, I argue that rather than accepting this at face value, we should analyze rare references to the mikveh and niddah within devotional texts to uncover implicit discussions of the body, health, healing, and family life. These elements provide crucial context for shifting hilkhot niddah practices. To this end, the article examines three prayer books by authors from Habsburg Bohemia and Moravia, illustrating how broader social and ideological shifts, alongside local contexts, shaped each text.",
