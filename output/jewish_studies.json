          "authors": "H. Feldman Samet",
          "abstract": "The late nineteenth century marked a transformative period for diverse communities in the Muslim world, including the Sabbatian Ma’aminim of Ottoman Salonica, commonly known as the Dönme. This article examines the Ma’aminim’s spatial practices and temporal frameworks—focusing in particular on the Izmirli subgroup—to offer a nuanced account of their layered identity and modes of engagement during this era of change. By analyzing sites ranging from homes and schools to hidden venues of worship and marketplaces, alongside messianic rhythms, life cycle rituals, and daily practices, the study highlights how these dimensions shaped their communal life amid processes of integration into a modernizing Ottoman society. Drawing on accounts by European observers and Jewish writers, the article examines how aspects of the Ma’aminim’s covert communal world became visible during this period, emphasizing the interplay between secrecy, public performance, and social transformation. Through the lens of the Ma’aminim’s distinctive experience, the article challenges static or ahistorical portrayals of communal structures, showing how spatial and temporal practices reflected multifaceted intersections of tradition, modernity, and identity. More broadly, it suggests an approach for understanding how communities in the late Ottoman era navigated multiple spaces and temporalities.",

          "title": "There’s No Home Like Place: Homogenizing Nostalgia Among Moroccan Jews in Venezuela",
          "authors": "Aviad Moreno",
          "abstract": "In the final third of the twentieth century the interpersonal ties between Moroccan Jewish migrants and their homeland significantly diminished due to migration patterns that effectively ended Jewish community life in Morocco. This shift led to the creation of Moroccan Jewish diaspora organizations, which fostered new community networks that became “melting pots” for the reconstructed memories of Morocco among migrants in their new places of residence. This study focuses on first-generation Jewish-Moroccan immigrants to Venezuela from 1970 to 2000. It builds on the idea that nostalgia—a selective process of remembering or creating a “place of memory” ( lieu de mémoire )—played a crucial role in shaping a highly contextualized memory of their Moroccan homeland, culminating in homogenized, collective narratives of Moroccan Jewish history. The research also explores the complex social and cultural mechanisms that contributed to the homogenization of space and time in nostalgic recollections. By juxtaposing dominant narratives of reattachment to Morocco with those of Jewish disengagement from Arab-Muslim lands, the study highlights the role of nostalgia in shaping the temporal and spatial frames of displacement narratives within immigrant communities. It highlights the importance of understanding the formation of collective memory among first-generation immigrants, particularly minority groups undergoing mass relocation, and advocates for a more nuanced approach to these communities’ stories about the places they left behind.",
